### Abstract

As the impacts of global climate change threaten the survival and function of coral reef ecosystems, a growing body of research is examining the response of reef-building corals to thermal and environmental stress. The physiological response of corals to stress is variable, with some showing increased capacity for survival and resilience. Research on the physiological condition of corals is limited, however, by the resolution and precision of current methodologies, often requiring time-intensive and destructive practices. Here, we describe a new methodology for characterizing two key metrics of coral physiology, tissue thickness and algal endosymbiont densities, using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and highlight the utility of this method for study of adult (Montipora capitata, Porites compressa, Pavona varians, and Pocillopora acuta) and juvenile (Pocillopora acuta) corals. We demonstrate LSCM methodology provides a novel, valid and precise tool to understand factors that influence the physiology of corals across life stages.
